This is a sample paragraph added for demonstration purposes. The goal is to showcase how changes appear in the Git history after performing a rebase. This text can be replaced or updated later with actual project content once the testing is complete. Rebase helps in maintaining a linear and clean commit structure, which is ideal for collaborative development workflows.
